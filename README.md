# Repeating Mathematical modelling and simulation of the thermo-catalytic decomposition of methane for economically improved hydrogen production:
## Background and Paper Reference: 
Brock Lumbers a, David W. Agar b, Joachim Gebel a, Frank Platte; Mathematical modelling and simulation of the thermo-catalytic decomposition of methane for economically improved hydrogen production. International Journal of Hydrogen Energy (Mathematical modelling and simulation of the thermo-catalytic decomposition of methane for economically improved hydrogen production - ScienceDirect).
The objective of this project is to repeat and enhance the model developed in the above paper. Hydrogen is a clean and sustainable energy carrier, and green hydrogen production methods are critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The thermo-catalytic methane decomposition (TCMD) process is a promising intermediate solution that generates no direct carbon dioxide emissions and can bridge the transition to green hydrogen whilst utilizing existing gas infrastructure.  
The motivation for choosing this subject is directly related to the huge ongoing effort in industry to produce green hydrogen and minimize greenhouse gas emission to achieve the world climate goals. This paper presents a study of hydrogen production utilizing the thermo-catalytic methane decomposition (TCMD) process:
Below list of ODEs that I will utilize from the paper to perform my analysis:
